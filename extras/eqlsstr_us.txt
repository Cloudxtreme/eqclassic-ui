8001 You have about %1 MB of memory.  We recommend that you only select %2 detailed models to get the best graphics performance.  A lower polygon model will be used for those models not selected.  The Wood Elf is required if you wish to display any Elf, and the Human is required if you wish to display the Erudite.
8002 Engine settings:
8003 You have about %1 MB of memory.  These settings will allow you to tune the system for the best performance.
8004 Turning this off will prevent sounds from playing in game.  Recommend: ON
8005 Turning this option on will enable the social animations for the detailed models.  This options is very memory intensive.  Recommend: OFF
8006 Mip Mapping causes the world to blend together better but uses more memory.  Recommend: OFF
8007 Any light source carried by a player requires the effect to be calculated and drawn.  Turning this off will make the graphics faster.  Recommend: ON
8008 This improves load time on many systems, at the expense of using extra disk space.  The first time you load any zone or the character selection screen with caching on, it will take time to build the cache, after that load times should be reduced.  Changing your settings here will require new caches to be built the next time you play.  Recommend: OFF
8009 This option will save memory at the cost of a very slight reduction of texture quality.  Recommend: OFF
8010 This will set your preferred resolution for game play.
