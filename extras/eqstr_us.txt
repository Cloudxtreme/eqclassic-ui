1110 Oh look..a talking lump of refuse..how novel!
1111 Is that your BREATH..or did something die in here..now go away!
1112 I didn't know Slime could speak common..go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.
1113 I wonder how much I could get for the tongue of a blithering fool..leave before I decide to find out for myself.
1114 You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.
1115 Your loyalty to our ideals has yet been proven.
1116 I'm not sure I can entrust you with this information yet.
1117 Come back when you have done more to further our campaign.
1118 Someone with your skills is more suited to beetle slaying..now run along.
1119 I think I saw a gnoll pup you could probably defeat, a few miles back.
1120 It's much safer for you to spend time fishing than on a dangerous issue like this.
1121 This matter is far too advanced for you to handle..come back after you've killed a few more large rats.
1122 It would be beneath you to bother with such issues.
1123 You are too experienced for such a task.
1124 Someone of your abilities would be wasted on this matter.
1125 You should not bother with such mundane issues.
1126 I don't like to speak to your ilk much less sell to them!
1127 Time to die %3.
1128 I am now accepting quests.
1129 I am no longer accepting quests.

1144 Welcome to my shop, %3.
1145 Hello there, %3. How about a nice %4?

1147 Hi there %3, just browsing?  Have you seen the %4 I just got in?
1148 Welcome to my shop, %3. You would probably find a %4 handy.
1149 Ahh..look, free entertainment. Can I have your stuff if you die??
1150 Hmm..I wonder who is going to win?
1151 It seems you two have a problem, better not involve me in it!

1156 Isn't there some kind of ordinance against %B3(13) crawling out from under their rocks?
1157 %B3(13) like you don't have any place in my shop..now make way for welcome customers.
1158 I thought scumbag %B3(13) like you just stole whatever they need.  Now GET OUT!
1159 I don't have anything to do with %B3(13)..move along.
1160 I don't have anything to do with your little gang..move along.
1161 It's not enough that you %B3(12) have ruined your own land. Now get lost!
1162 I have something here that %B3(12) use..let me see...it's the EXIT, now get LOST!
1163 Don't you %B3(12) have your own merchants?  Whatever, I'm not selling anything to you!
1164 Members of your little "club" have ruined things around here..get lost!
1165 I don't have anything to do with your damned club..move along.
1166 Creatures like you make me sick..the things you do..get out of here Pagan!
1167 After all the things you've done..the things you believe in..leave my shop!
1168 Actions speak louder than beliefs, and I despise both your actions and all you believe in.
1169 Get out of here now!
1170 I am tolerant by nature..but infidels like you push me past my limit..get out!
1171 I cannot abide you or your actions against all that is right..BE GONE!

1177 It's %B3(12) like you who have ruined your own lands. You'll not ruin mine!
1178 %B3(12) like you are better left dead than alive.
1179 %B3(12) have no place in our realm!
1180 Your actions and history are a personal affront to all I stand for!
1181 I shall rid the land of another infamous villain!
1182 Your foul deeds have earned my contempt!
1183 Your intolerable reputation insults all in this realm!
1184 Your beliefs are an insult to us all!
1185 It's time for you to take your blasphemy into the next realm!
1186 Heathen! Unbeliever! Norrath must be cleansed!
1187 Your faithless devotion to a false god leaves me no choice!
1188 Your guild must be destroyed!
1189 This %3 looks nice.

1191 You will not evade me %3!

At times, they will even turn their aggression on members of their own race.  This has led to distrust between the Craknek Warriors and the Greenblood Knights.

2037 If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2038 Through great magic you are able to enhance and protect yourself and your allies while cursing or beguiling your foes.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2039 As a wizard you are part of an elite organization of High Elves known as the Keepers of the Art.
2040 The High Elves were masters of the Art when most of the other magic using races were barely able to keep themselves out of the elements.  While nearly every fair elf will treat you with the honor and respect you deserve, many of the younger races are not able to humble themselves before you.  The Teir'Dal conclave known as The Dead twist and pervert the Art into their own image and are your bitterest of foes.
2041 Through arcane means you are able to channel raw energy from the Planes of Power and Discord into spells of great destructive force.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2042 As a loyal Priest of Tunare, the Elfmother, you are a revered member of High Elf society.  You are a spiritual leader and healer and it is your duty to see to the health and well being of all fair elves by using the powers Tunare has blessed you with.
2043 Are you absolutely sure you want to destroy your %1?

2045 It is also your responsibility to keep a watchful eye out for the machinations of the evil gods, especially Innoruuk and his Dark Elven disciples.  And to destroy them should they threaten any of Tunare's creations.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2046 As a member of the Dismal Rage and a loyal warrior of Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate and father of the Teir'Dal, you will be branded as a traitor to your own race.  Beware of the Arcane Scientists, for if they discover your dark ways they will do all in their considerable power to stop you.  You will also not be welcome in the halls of the Steel Warriors.  When they all fall before the might of Innoruuk you shall be vindicated.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2047 Welcome to Ak'Anon, the mysterious, magical, mechanical home of the Gnomes!  
2048 The Deep Muses, operating out of a temple dedicated to both Brell and Bristlebane, look at life as a fun and challenging puzzle to be solved through experiences and adventures. Danger and mystery are your way of life.
2049 Traveling gnomes are generally treated quite well by most civilized foreigners. You must beware of dark forces at work within your homeland. Gnomes that have embraced the dark ways of the Plaguebringer and the Kobolds, age-old enemies of the Dwarves and Gnomes, both seek to destroy the Ak'Anon of your birth.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2050 As one of the few gnomes to hear the call of the Plaguebringer you must worship in secret and keep your true dark desires from your fellow gnomes, especially the Eldrich Collective, or else they will banish you from the workshops of Ak'Anon.
2051 There are several gnomes who also believe in the power of Bertoxxulous and form a group known as the Dark Reflection.
2052 As a Shadowknight you are a respected and feared member of your conclave for your training in both warfare and the dark arts of necromancy.
2053 If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2054 As one of the few gnomes to hear the call of the Plaguebringer you must worship in secret and keep your true dark desires from your fellow gnomes, especially the Eldrich Collective and Deep Muses, or else they will banish you from the workshops of Ak'Anon.
2055 As a loyal warrior of the Plaguebringer you often asked to place your life on the line for the greater glory of the Plaguebringer and are expected to do so willingly.
2056 As one of the Gemchoppers you are a valued citizen of Ak'Anon.  While most of the day to day guard duties are handled by the Clockworks, the Gemchoppers provide additional security and protection to Ak'Anon.  Many gnomish warriors also seek out the life of an adventurer but all return to Ak'Anon and the Gemchoppers to pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generation of proud young gnomes.
2057 As a loyal Priest of the Plaguebringer you are greatly feared and respected by other members of the Dark Reflection.
2058 The clerics of Ak'Anon are a strange breed.  Along with the gnomish rogues they operate the Abbey of Deep Musing, a temple devoted to both Brell Serilis and Fizzlethorp Bristlebane.  The Deep Muses look at life as a fun and challenging puzzle to be solved through experiences and adventures.  Danger and mystery are your way of life.
2059 As a loyal rogue of the Plaguebringer most often are called upon to use your powers of stealth to spy on and eliminate possible threats to our dark secret.
2060 The rogues of Ak'Anon are a strange breed.  Along with the gnomish clerics they operate the Abbey of Deep Musing, a temple devoted to both Brell Serilis and Fizzlethorp Bristlebane.  The Deep Muses look at life as a fun and challenging puzzle to be solved through experiences and adventures.  Danger and mystery are your way of life. Traveling gnomes are generally treated quite well by most civilized foreigners. You must beware though of dark forces at work within your homeland.  Several gnomes have embraced the dark ways of the Plaguebringer and they seek to destroy the Ak'Anon of your birth.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2061 Are you absolutely sure you want to destroy the money you are holding?
2062 As a member of the Eldrich Collective you spend most of your time and considerable power blazing new trails in magical research and experimentation.
2063 Through great magic you are able to enhance and protect yourself and your allies while cursing or beguiling your foes.
2064 While the Eldrich Collective is a shining example of the gnomish thirst for knowledge, there also exists group of gnomes who lurk in the shadows and who's experiments have delved into depths of necromancy.  Beware of the Dark Reflection.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2065 You are feared even within your conclave for you seek to master the dark art of death, necromancy.
2066 Through arcane means you are able to channel raw energy from the Planes of Power and Discord into spells of great destructive force.
2067 Through great magic you are able to summon forth extra-planar beings to do your bidding.
2068  Yours is the sword which cleaves the dark asunder. While other Seekers use either their faith in Cazic-Thule or their necromantic powers to reveal the Dark Truth, you prefer a more forceful approach. Insights into the Dark Truth can often be found in the dying eyes of your foes. 
2069 Paineel is your home and only safe haven. Even Antonica offers no shelter, as the humans in Qeynos have sided against you, fearing the power Cazic-Thule has granted you, and force you to sneak like a rat through their sewers or be slain.@> This Race/Class/Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2070 Welcome to Erudin, city of high men and knowledge!  
2071  As a loyal Priest of Prexus it is your duty to look after the health and well being of all Erudites wherever their quest for knowledge and power may take them, especially when their journeys take them across vast seas or oceans.
2072 Are you sure you wish to loot this NO TRADE item?
2073 Also always be on guard against the Heretics, traitors to Erudin and worshippers of Cazic-Thule, who practice the forbidden art of necromancy.@>  This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2074 This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2075  Subjects held in thrall by fear of your god, Cazic-Thule, provide the door through which you seek the Dark Truth. The screams of fear emanating from the Tabernacle act as a soothing balm to your senses.  Dedicated to Cazic-Thule you walk unafraid where others quake in fear. Paineel is your home and your only truly safe haven. Whereas your fellow seekers who have not dedicated their lives to Cazic-Thule must sneak like rats through most of Norrath, you stride boldly. However, caution should always be taken as your deeds may very well cause those who once tolerated you to become enemies.@> This Race/Class/Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2076  As a loyal Priest of Quellious you are a voice of reason and tolerance in the xenophobic Erudite society.  In place of contempt you feel pity for the less evolved races.  You find it cute that the Ashen Order seeks the favor of The Tranquil when they are simply incapable of appreciating it.  If only the other races would just accept their proper place all these seemingly endless conflicts might cease.
2077 As a Deepwater Knight, loyal paladins of Prexus it is your duty to look after the defense and protection of all Erudites wherever their quests for knowledge and power may take them, especially when their journeys take them across vast seas or oceans.
2078 While their ignorant and savage ways sicken you, humans seem to bear you little to no ill will.  The Teir'Dal and their brutish underlings seem violently jealous of your superior intellect and spirituality.  Also always be on guard against the Heretics, traitors to Erudin and worshippers of Cazic-Thule, who practice the forbidden art of necromancy.@>
2079 As a Peacekeeper, loyal paladins of Quellious, you are charged with the protection and defense of all Erudites from all external and internal forces.  If only the other races would just accept their proper place all these seemingly endless conflicts might cease.
2080 You have been given permission to drag %1's corpse in %2.
2081  By your misguided Erudite brethren you have been labeled 'Heretic' for practicing necromancy. Their ignorance of the Dark Truth, which you pursue, has made you the monster in the tales with which they frighten their misbehaving children. Nevertheless you and your fellow Seekers continue to employ necromantic art to expand your knowledge of the Dark Truth. 
2082 As a member of the Crimson Hands
2083  you are a respected member of Erudite society, whether you spend your time doing research to expand the Erudin City Library's collection or seeking the knowledge that only travel and danger can bring.  While their ignorant and savage ways sicken you, humans seem to bear you little to no ill will.  The Teir'Dal and their brutish underlings seem violently jealous of your superior intellect and mastery of things arcane.
2084  Through great magic you are able to channel raw energy from the Planes of Power and Discord into spells of great destructive force.
2085 As a member of the Gatecallers
2086  Through great magic you are able to summon forth extra-planar beings to do your bidding.
2087 As a member of the Craftkeepers
2088  Through great magic you are able to enhance and protect yourself and your allies while cursing or beguiling your foes.
2089 Welcome to Kaladim, The Forge of Norrath!  
2090 As a loyal Cleric of Underfoot it is your duty to tend to the health and well being of all of the sons and daughters of Kaladim wherever their adventurous hearts may take them, even into the homelands of our most hated of enemies, the ogres of Oggok.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2091 As a loyal Paladin of Underfoot it is your unending crusade to rid Norrath of evil in all its forms, especially the Greenblood Knights of Oggok.  You follow a strict code of honor and loyalty and should never flee from a battle while your comrades fight on, for to do so makes you no better than a cowardly Teir'Dal.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2092 The rogues of Miners Guild 628 secretly operate the Mines of Kaladim.  From this base, rogues are dispatched all over Norrath in search of silver, gold, and gems.  While most of Kaladim suspect the guild exists, most look the other way because the 'miners' rarely rob other dwarves.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2093 The dwarven warriors of the Stormguard are stout and proud and willingly give their lives to protect Kaladim.  King Kazon Stormhammer demands and receives their undying loyalty.  It is expected for all dwarven warriors to adventure and bring glory to Kaladim through valiant battle with our mortal enemies, the ogres of Oggok.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2094 Welcome to Neriak!  Dark and damp, Neriak is home to the sons and daughters of Innoruuk, the Teir'Dal.  
2095 As a warrior you are expected to join the Indigo Brotherhood, a guild of fierce Teir'Dal who support King Naythox Thex unwaveringly.  While you hold a place of respect and honor in dark elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2096 As a shadowknight disciple of Innoruuk,
2097 you are a respected and feared member of dark elven society.  You are allied with an organization of shadowknights and necromancers loyal to Queen Cristanos Thex known only as The Dead.  You believe that necromancy and the power of Innoruuk are the only true magiks and look down upon those who practice other arcane sciences.  While you hold a place of respect and honor in Dark Elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.  Sow your seeds of hatred far and wide and bridge the Ocean of Tears with fair elf corpses.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2098 As a rogue you are expected to join the ranks of the Ebon Mask.  It is forbidden for dark elf thieves to prey upon their own.  Many non-Teir'Dal cities have given their guards orders to attack dark elves on sight.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2099 As a devoted Priest of Innoruuk, you are a well respected member of dark elven society. While you hold a place of respect and honor in dark elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.  Sow your seeds of hatred far and wide and bridge the Ocean of Tears with fair elf corpses.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2100 As a practitioner of the dark art of necromancy,
2101 In spite of the fact that you have turned your back upon the one true art of necromancy you are still tolerated within the walls of Neriak.  As one of The Spurned, you have a slightly better chance of being accepted by non-Teir'Dal, especially among the Arcane Scientists, but this will require much work on your part and will insure that you are hunted and killed by your own people should you return to Neriak. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2102 For now.  As a necromancer loyal to the will of Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer, you are a valued member of the Bloodsabers.

3239 The hardy race of Barbarians, or Northmen, use their wisdom and formidable brawn to defend honor and justice.  Their magnificent stature is a sight to behold; even more so when it is unleashed in battle.  Barbarians are one of the tallest races to walk the lands of Norrath.<BR><BR>As a tribal culture, Barbarians are a little rough around the edges when it comes to interactions with other races.  Even the Barbarians' mannerisms and features have a rugged quality.  <BR><BR>The Barbarians consider themselves superior to other inhabitants of Norrath, particularly the Teir`Dal and Erudites, which are viewed as pathetically weak.  Barbarians have a special place in their hearts for the Dwarves of Kaladim whom they view as steadfast and brave.  The high quality of Dwarven mead may also have some influence on the cordial relationship between the two races.  Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, and the other evil races are hated, as they directly oppose the Barbarians' sense of justice.  <BR><BR>Barbarians live in the frigid city of Halas, nestled amidst the icy peaks of Everfrost in Northern Antonica.  The city is rather rudimentary, but serves the needs of the Barbarians that call it home.
3240 The Teir`Dal, or Dark Elves, are a twisted reflection of the Elves of light, but are just as lithe and intelligent as their cousins.  Their features are often soft and delicate, though the eyes of the Dark Elves betray their darker inclinations.  The Dark Elves' skin ranges from blue tones to black and their hair is most often white with some variances.  They reach a height of about 5 feet tall.<BR><BR>Innoruuk, Lord of Hate, created the Teir`Dal and his hatred flows through their veins and moves their black hearts.  It runs so deep that the Teir`Dal hate all, including their own kind and their creator.  <BR><BR>The Dark Elves view all other races as inferior; tools to be used for their own evil manipulations.  Most races fear the Dark Elves.  The Teir`Dal would desire the fall of the rest of the Elven world, leaving them broken, eradicated, or enslaved.  Though viewed as inferior and dimwitted, Trolls and Ogres are tolerated as they are useful in the Teir`Dal plans for conquest.<BR><BR>There is a labyrinth of evil under the Nektulos Forest called Neriak, the home city of the Dark Elves.  Its entrance is deep within gloomy shadows of the woods.
3241 Though made lower to the ground than most races, the Dwarves created by Brell Serilis burst with pride and determination.  The stout and sturdy Dwarves are extremely strong, making them one of the best-suited to endure long and intense battles.  Dwarves have broad faces, usually with a prominent nose, and take extraordinary pride in their hair.  Males often take great care to grow long beards and moustaches and females often tie their hair up in a bun.  Some females also sport a finely trimmed beard.<BR><BR>This ancient race is strongly motivated by honor and loyalty.  They also know how to balance work and play, and know how to tell a good story.  If a Dwarf is ever wronged, it can be painful for the wrongdoer as Dwarves tend to hold a grudge.  <BR><BR>Dwarves can be somewhat abrasive, but find friendship easiest with the Barbarians, Humans, Gnomes, and Halflings.  The Dwarves tolerate the Elves of light, but they despise the Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races.  <BR><BR>Built within the Butcherblock Mountains and amidst a series of mines, the stronghold of Kaladim houses the Dwarven race and royalty.
3242 The Erudites trace their ancestry back to the great mage, Erud, who led them to Odus.  They are descendents of the original humans on Norrath and inherited the best of human intelligence.  Their extraordinary acumen came at the price of thinner, more delicate bodies.  Erudites reach about six feet tall, with some of that height attributed to their high foreheads.  <BR><BR>Unique accomplishments with magic and study have understandably led the Erudites to believe that they are the most intellectually superior race on Norrath.  They are known for their serious demeanor.<BR><BR>Most Erudites spend their days absorbed in books and tomes, or magical contemplation, and they typically do not involve themselves in matters that do not directly affect them.  They often pay no regard to anyone that hasn't achieved intellectual accomplishment.  That in mind, Erudites do not associate with the evil races.  Even the Erudite Heretics of Paineel are not fond of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls.<BR><BR>The Erudites live in two areas on the continent of Odus near the Toxxulia Forest.  One city, housing the purer of heart, is called Erudin--an ornate city gleaming with polished marble and babbling fountains.   Paineel is the home of the rebellious Erudite Heretics who were banished from the city for delving into the forbidden realm of dark magic.
3243 The mixing of Elf and Human is a common tale.  Many stories of romance between these two races can be heard around Norrath.  As a result, Half Elves are taller than their Elven ancestors and carry some of the strength of their human bloodlines.  They have slightly harsher features than Elves, but the mix still makes them pleasant to lay eyes on.  <BR><BR>Unfortunately, the children of these forbidden romances are often shunned, becoming victims of prejudice by Humans and Elves alike.  Most Half Elves are unaffected by the discrimination and retain a pleasant manner.  Usually Half Elves will develop a very close and trusted group of friends that act as a surrogate family.  <BR><BR>The difficult lives of the Half Elves, and their lack of ties to any one place makes them adept travelers of the world and exceptional friends and storytellers.  Sadly, some Half Elves become embittered by the constant difficulty of finding a place in the world and choose a path of thievery.  The Half Elves are on amicable terms with most races in Norrath, but have no affection for the evil races.  <BR><BR>While Half Elves can be seen in many areas of the world, they are primarily found in the Wood Elf city of Kelethin and within the Surefall Glade.
3244 Halflings are aptly named, as they are half the size of the average height for most of Norrath's races.  They usually measure about three feet in height and are often thick around their middles.  Their lack of height is not be confused as a weakness though; if confronted or threatened, Halflings are very capable.<BR><BR>Halflings are happy-go-lucky and hospitable.  Any one of them would readily give their life for a friend.  They are renowned for their tomfoolery and humor, always appreciating a bit of fun.  They especially like to tease Erudites for their lack of wit.  Enjoying what each day brings is a large part of their lives.  <BR><BR>Halflings tend to get along well with most races, except those that are truly evil, but even then rare friendships are made with members of the less savory races.  <BR><BR>The quaint, stunted city of Rivervale lies between the Kithicor Forest and Misty Thicket in central Antonica.  It is crowded with skilled tradesman, taverns, and friendly folk.
3245 The High Elves, also known as the Koada`Dal, are regarded as the closest relatives of the original Norrathian Elves created by Tunare, Mother of All.  These noble creatures stand tall with ivory skin and gentle features.  They are certainly not the most sturdy of races, but make up for that with heart.  Throughout the ages, they have stood for freedom and justice, fighting evil with powerful magic and their skills with the blade.  <BR><BR>The High Elves are known for their civilized conduct and, as such, are perceived as a race rather full of their own importance, though they are quite benevolent.  They expect to be treated with respect and do have an haughty pride about them.  As a result, it is difficult to make friends with a High Elf.<BR><BR>The High Elves feel their cousins, the Wood Elves, are to be sought out as loyal servants.  This noble race views Humans, Gnomes, and Halflings as worthy of their presence.  Dwarves, Barbarians, and Erudites, however, are simply endured.  The High Elves expend little effort to help them.  The evil races are looked upon with contempt and will be dispatched when opportunity presents itself.<BR><BR>The home of the High Elves is within the magnificent and pristine architecture of the city of Felwithe.  The structures crafted behind the walls make the beauty of the surrounding forests pale.  The city lies within the Greater Faydark on the continent of Faydwer.
3246 The strength of the Human race lies in its diversity of thought, belief, and profession; though they tend be weaker than many other races.  They have no particular specialty with the sword or arcane magic.  While that is true, Humans are cunning and possess great ingenuity, which gives them an advantage.  The Human mind is sharp enough to adapt to nearly all forms of study and this gives them a great range of options when choosing a profession.  <BR><BR>Humans often divide themselves with their own squabbles, but they will always return to their brother's side in times of crisis, or to protect a mutual interest.  <BR><BR>Humans generally get along well with most good and neutral races, depending on their beliefs and the path of their profession.  Humans are not so friendly toward Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races.  Dark Elves are tolerated within Freeport, but they tend to be mistrusted, even feared.  <BR><BR>The port cities of Qeynos and Freeport lie on opposite coasts of Antonica, and are the most common homes for the Humans.  These two cities are the center of Human activity, although this race can be found wandering on virtually every continent of Norrath and beyond.
3247 The fearsome and savage reptilian race on Norrath is known as the Iksar.  With their significant height, scales, and long tails, Iksar are intimidating in their appearance.  However, their reptilian physiology grants them a natural affinity for water, as well as enhanced regeneration.<BR><BR>Their entire civilization developed in isolation for centuries and fostered an unusual culture.  The Iksar are a tribal race with a very simple social structure.  Allies to no one, the Iksar are intelligent and proud.  Having seen their race crumble through the toils of war, the race has become bitter about its loss of power.  After being slaves and warring with the Ring of Scale, they were nearly made extinct.<BR><BR>The Iksar depend only on their god and creator, Cazic Thule.  Iksar are unwelcome in all known cities of Norrath.  Iksar are not too fond of any of the races in Norrath.<BR><BR>The Iksar live in the ancient city of Cabilis, on Kunark near the Lake of Ill Omen.  It is a dark place with a maze of canals, which the Iksar use for travel around their city.
3248 With their lumbering gait and enormous breadth, Ogres are an ominous presence.  Created by Rallos Zek, these massive creatures are feared in battle for their raw strength and uncanny endurance.  While not very intelligent, Ogres are known to cooperate with one another quite efficiently.  <BR><BR>The Ogres have a twisted sense of duty that could easily be mistaken for stupidity.  They are, justifiably, quite single-minded.  Their thick skulls also give them a  high level of resistance to being stunned in battle.<BR><BR>Ogres have been known to be cannibalistic, but are more partial to eating Humans, Erudites, and High Elves.  Nearly all of the good and neutral races avoid them out of self-preservation.  Ogres have learned to work with the Trolls, but have no love for them, and they fear Dark Elves.  <BR><BR>The crude tunneled city of Oggok lies within the Feerrott, a jungle-like area bordering the Innothule Swamp and Rathe Mountains in southern Antonica.  The home city for the Ogres is a fairly slow-paced civilization that focuses on battle training and magic to give them an upper hand in battle.
3249 Trolls are often considered a hideous and deplorable race that carries a sickening smell.  This view suits the Troll as they are generally unpleasant to everyone.  Trolls are an immense race, at least twice as strong as the average human.  They have the ability to regenerate faster than most other races.  Trolls have two primary motivators: food and power.  These grotesque creatures will eat just about anything.  <BR><BR>Trolls are extremely cruel and their greed is almost insatiable.  Trolls also fancy they have advanced abilities in the culinary arts, with their ability to pickle just about anything, or make a meal out of "spare parts."<BR><BR>Trolls generally detest and distrust the other races and even their own kind.  They tend to put up with the Dark Elves out of fear, much like Ogres do.  <BR><BR> Very recently, in a historic battle led by Warlord Ykesha, the Trolls triumphed and took back their city of Grobb from the Frogloks in the Innothule Swamp of Antonica.

3273 The Vah Shir are a regal feline race that walk upright.  They were once the ruling class of other similar cat-like races on Odus.  Since being translocated onto an alien moon by a collision of Erudite magic, they learned to survive and became stronger.  Vah Shir are as tall as Barbarians and display a variety of different markings on their fur, based on their lineage.  In spite of their height, they are very agile and graceful.  They are known for their integrity and the destructive feral power they bring down on their enemies.  <BR><BR>Vah Shir follow no particular religion, but they do pay homage to their king, Raja Kerrath.  Because of the adversity they have faced, the Vah Shir share a tight bond with one another and are extremely loyal to kin.  The Vah Shir are selfless and focus on the good of all rather than their individual needs.  <BR><BR>Because the Vah Shir are not exposed to the daily struggles in Norrath, they are indifferent to the various races of Norrath.<BR><BR>Shar Vahl is the majestic den of the Vah Shir.  The city was built high above Norrath, on the moon known as Luclin.  The city is located between the Hollowshade Moor and Shadeweaver's Thicket.
3274 The Wood Elves, or Feir`Dal, are more accepting of others than their cousins, the High Elves.  Like their Elven cousins, Wood Elves only reach about five feet in height and have very attractive and subtle features.  Their skins are tinged an oaken color so that they blend with their natural surroundings in the forests.  <BR><BR>Wood Elves generally regard those who respect nature as friends, especially rangers and druids.  The Wood Elves believe in co-existing with their natural surroundings as opposed to shaping them.  This leads most of their kind to worship Tunare, the Mother of All.  The Feir`Dal harness the powers of song and the living, breathing properties of their environment.  Wood Elves are known for their love of celebration and good food.  A good song will also tweak their pointed ears.<BR><BR>Wood Elves get along well with most good and neutral races, and merely dislike most evil races.  They hold great malice toward the Dark Elves--an aberration of their ancestors--as well as their allies.<BR><BR>The Feir`Dal are at home in the trees in their intricate city of Kelethin, which hangs high above the ground between the trunks and branches of the Greater Faydark.  Comprised of platforms and suspension bridges, Kelethin is both well defended and beautiful.

3316 The Frogloks are a race of sentient amphibians.  While they may be short, Frogloks are sturdy.  They can swim underwater for long distances and can see well in the dark.  They are clumsy on land as they are required to hop, but they can cross great distances with each leap.<BR><BR>Frogloks willingly die to defend truth, justice, and honor.  In the recent past, Mithaniel Marr chose the Frogloks to perform some of his tasks on Norrath and enlightened them as a reward for their accomplishments.  The valor bestowed upon them and their eagerness to serve their god is admirable.<BR><BR>The Frogloks harbor disdain for all that is evil.  They have a tolerance for the Humans and share a rapport with the Northmen.  Other good and neutral races are well liked and viewed as allies that share a common enemy.<BR><BR>The Frogloks have been forced out of their first home within the Innothule Swamp of Antonica by the Trolls and have found a new home, the Outpost of Gukta, in Rathe Mountains.
3317 Bards are jack-of-all-trades adventurers who use music to create a wide variety of magical effects. Though they often use melee weapons, bards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield many different types of weapons and instruments.<BR><BR>Bards can do a little bit of everything. Their songs can regenerate health and mana, increase attack speed and accuracy, momentarily charm angry enemies, help friends resist many types of damage and even directly damage enemies. Bards are perhaps best known, however, for their ability to greatly increase the foot speed of their group.<BR><BR>Bards have the unique ability to create multiple effects at once. By weaving different songs together, a bard can customize effects to any situation. This makes nimble fingers and quick thinking a must for those who want to play a bard.<BR><BR>Bards do well both alone and in groups. With the right combination of songs, they can adapt to many different challenges. The bard is a great class for players who enjoy a wide variety of play options but are quick to adapt to a changing situation.
3318 Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons, or use their bare hands to attack.<BR><BR>Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells. Beastlords share every battle with their warders, fighting along side these fierce companions or falling back to heal and aid.<BR><BR>Beastlords also gain spells to slow or damage their opponents. Beastlords can heal and add to an ally's health and mana regeneration as well, making them a well-rounded ally in battle.<BR><BR>Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places. They depend upon coordination with their warders and well planned spells to finish every fight, but they can also aid a group through their spells and melee abilities. The beastlord is a great class for players who like the option of solo melee fights, but want to be able to help in a group.
3319 Clerics dedicate their lives to the gods of Norrath, gaining magical powers in exchange for their faith and service. Clerics are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield blunt weapons.<BR><BR>Clerics gain powerful healing and enhancement spells, greatly increasing the health and defenses of their group, while keeping them healed in the most dangerous battles. While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<BR><BR>Clerics are potent enemies of the undead, able to channel their holy fervor into highly destructive banishment spells. Resurrection is also the domain of the cleric, allowing them to bring their fallen companions back from the dead without the normal penalties for death.<BR><BR>With a few exceptions, clerics are dependent on being part of a group. But they are highly desirable group members. An experienced cleric is a great benefit to any group and is an excellent choice for the social player.
3320 Druids are disciples of the wilds, following the teachings of the Norrathian gods of nature. Druids are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons and scimitars.<BR><BR>Druidic magic takes many forms, allowing the druid to fill a wide variety of roles when in a group or adventuring alone. Druids possess excellent healing abilities, powerful mana and health regenerative spells, and valuable enhancements that improve the health and armor of their group.<BR><BR>Offensively, druids are both powerful and versatile. They have access to fire and cold-based damage spells, a selection of disease and swarm spells that damage their enemies over time, and devastating banishment spells focused upon unnaturally summoned creatures. Druids also gain some of the best travel spells, including the ability to speed up their group's movement and teleport their group to distant regions.<BR><BR>Druids are a well-rounded class, prospering in both solo and grouped situations. An experienced druid is able to adventure alone, but is equally at home in a group. The druid is an excellent class for players who enjoy a variety of play styles and options.
3321 Enchanters are the most subtle of spell casters, with little focus on doing damage directly but tremendous impact on the world around them. Enchanters are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Enchanters specialize on improving the minds of their allies, with unmatched mana regeneration spells and mental enhancements. Haste spells are also the domain of the enchanter, providing incredible boosts in attack speed for members of their group. Enchanters have many powers of illusion as well, allowing them to take the form of many different creatures and races.<BR><BR>In battle, enchanters are able to bring order to chaotic situations, often saving their group in a fight that would otherwise be lost. Enchanters possess the ability to mesmerize their enemies, temporarily removing them from a battle. Attack slowing spells are also a specialty, dramatically lowering the speed of a monster's attacks for a period of time. In many situations, enchanters can call upon powerful charm spells to subjugate the mind of a monster and command it to do the enchanter's bidding. <BR><BR>Enchanters are a powerful class, but often rely upon a group to reach their full potential. Experienced enchanters thrive in chaotic situations where they can make the most of their offensive abilities. The enchanter is a good choice for players who enjoy playing in groups and like to take charge of challenging situations.
3322 Magicians are master summoners, able to call elemental pets to do their bidding and to conjure useful items from thin air. Magicians are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Elemental pets are at the heart of a magician's offensive strategy, and typically accompany a magician in all his adventures. This pet provides protection for its master, along with powerful attacks and special abilities. Magicians have a large selection of fire and magic-based damage spells, allowing them to mount a damaging magical assault in support of their elemental pet.<BR><BR>Magicians have a wide range of summoning spells, allowing them to conjure such diverse items as food, weapons, armor, and magical jewelry. In battle, the magician can encase his entire group in a shield of fire, damaging any opponent that strikes them. Magicians also have spells that lower a monster's resistance to magic, allowing spells to damage them more easily.<BR><BR>Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power in their area of expertise. Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation. The magician is a good choice for players who enjoy managing a powerful pet and using a tightly focused spell selection.
3323 Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines. Monks are a melee class with the ability to wear leather armor, wield blunt weapons, and use unarmed combat styles.<BR><BR>Monks forego heavy armor and almost all weapons in order to hone themselves into masters of combat, using their fists and a stout staff to make their mark upon Norrath. Monks learn many special attacks to enhance their damage dealing abilities, including the dragon punch and the legendary flying kick.<BR><BR>In their martial studies monks also learn other useful skills, including the ability to move silently and fall safely from great heights. Experienced monks also learn to feign death, slowing their body's functions enough to fool most observers into believing them dead -- this trick often allows the monk to escape dangerous situations as monsters wander off, thinking the monk defeated.<BR><BR>Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone. The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.
3324 Necromancers are servants of the dark gods, studying ancient and mysterious tomes to gain power over the world of the dead. Necromancers are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Necromancers are able to raise the dead, commanding them to do their bidding and aid them in battle. A skeletal servant often accompanies the necromancer in her adventures throughout Norrath. Necromancers have mastered the powers of poison and disease, allowing them to assault their enemies with damaging afflictions that savage their vitality over time.<BR><BR>Necromancers learn to control and mimic the dead, allowing them to escape harm, convert their health to mana, and bend the minds of the undead to serve their cause. The power of shadow also is within the domain of the necromancer, with spells that bind and choke their enemies in darkness, hide the necromancer in a cloak of invisibility, and teleport through the shadows to escape danger.<BR><BR>Necromancers are a very self-sufficient class and often choose to adventure alone, though they can provide great value to a group as well. The necromancer is an excellent choice for the independent player who enjoys a wide variety of abilities.
3325 Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath. Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<BR><BR>Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<BR><BR>Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.
3326 Rangers are warriors attuned to the ways of nature, able to call upon the power of the wild to aid them in their fights. Rangers are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Rangers are scouts and hunters, able to track enemies from a great distance and engage them with deadly ranged attacks, but rangers can also fight well in a melee, using two weapons to attack their foes.<BR><BR>Rangers have spells drawn from nature. They can increase run speed and add to an ally's armor, health or ability to attack. In a pinch, they can heal or directly damage enemies with fiery attacks.<BR><BR>Rangers can hunt alone or in a group, though allies allow them to best use their abilities. A ranger's bow is a welcome addition to a group, adding a good deal of damage. The ranger is a great class for players who like to engage in melee battles between trips to explore the broad expanse of Norrath.
3327 Rogues are the stealthy thieves and vicious assassins that stalk the shadows of Norrath. Rogues are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and use piercing, slashing and some blunt weapons.<BR><BR>Rogues are sneaky fighters who always seek to take advantage of enemies by attacking from behind. Rogues can backstab enemies for extra damage, using poisoned weapons for added effect. Rogues can detect traps, pick locks and pockets, and fall safely from great heights.<BR><BR>Rogues are known for their ability to sneak and hide. This allows them to move almost anywhere, exploring the dangers that lie ahead. Combined with rogue items that use illusions, rogues make excellent scouts.<BR><BR>Rogues are a specialist class that works best with a group of friends. Rogues can add greatly to the killing power of a group. The rogue is a good choice for players who like to do heavy damage while walking the dangerous edge of dungeon exploration.
3328 Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<BR><BR>Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy’s ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<BR><BR>Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight’s lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.
3329 Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<BR><BR>Shamanic magic has two main focuses--enhancing the mind and body of the shaman’s allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman’s enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman’s group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<BR><BR>The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman’s arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster’s attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<BR><BR>Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.
3330 Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<BR><BR>Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies’ attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<BR><BR>Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.
3331 Wizards dedicate their lives to learning the powers of fire, ice, and magic; channeling their knowledge into ever more destructive spells to unleash upon their enemies. Wizards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Wizards are the most single-minded of spell casters, with the majority of their spells dedicated to delivering massive amounts of damage as rapidly as possible. To aid in their constant search for power, wizard have also perfected the art of teleportation--allowing them to instantly transport themselves and their allies to the most remote corners of Norrath and beyond.<BR><BR>Wizards are a tightly focused class, gaining the greatest ability to deal magical damage in exchange for limited variety in their spell selection. Wizards are capable adventurers both solo and in groups, and are an excellent choice for players who live to blow things up.
3332 Strength is one factor in determining how much damage you do with weapons and special attacks.  It directly affects the amount of weight you can carry before suffering penalties.  It also increases your chance to gain Offense and Bash skill points.<BR><BR>Tradeskills:  If your strength is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Blacksmithing.
3333 Stamina increases your maximum hitpoints.  Different classes get more hit points per point of stamina than others.  Stamina also determines your maximum air supply when you are underwater or in an airless zone.
3334 Agility is one factor in determining your avoidance--how often NPC’s will miss when trying to hit you.  It also increases your chances to gain points in some combat skills.
3335 Dexterity affects your chances for special melee abilities such as combat effects and critical hits.  It increases your chances to gain points in most combat skills.  It is also a factor in determining how much damage you do with throwing weapons and archery.<BR><BR>Bard Only:  High dexterity decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.<BR><BR>Tradeskills:  If your dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make Poison.
3336 Wisdom affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your intelligence.<BR><BR>Wisdom is the primary spell-casting attribute for Paladins, Rangers, Beastlords, Clerics, Shaman, and Druids.  If affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  It also determines how often a spell will fail to be cast correctly (fizzle).
3337 Intelligence affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your wisdom.<BR><BR>Intelligence is the primary spell-casting attribute for Shadowknights, Bards, Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, and Magicians.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  For all except bards, it also determines how often a spell will fail to cast correctly (fizzle).
3338 Charisma affects how much merchants will charge you for their wares.  It also affects the chances for charm, memory blur, mesmerization, and divine intervention spell effects to work.<BR><BR>Bard only:  High charisma decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.
3339 While Gnomes are knee-high to some of the taller races, they make up for it with their cleverness and skills.  They are by no means a strong and sturdy race, but their edge is their dexterity and intelligence.  They were the second race, after Dwarves, created by Brell Serilis.  <BR><BR>Gnomes have an innate preoccupation and skill with gadgets.  They are a curious race that creates strange, but very useful items that enhance their lives.  Gnomes have created a number of fantastic machines, including an observatory which houses one of the most powerful telescopes in Norrath.  Even with all of their accomplishments, gnomes are rarely taken seriously because of their size and behavior.  <BR><BR>Gnomes are friendly with all good Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, and Humans.  Although they do not quite understand the Erudites, they will interact with them.  Gnomes have a general aversion to Trolls, Ogres, Teir`Dal, and other evil races, but don’t necessarily hate them.  <BR><BR>The clicking of gears and clacking of machinery fill the mechanized Gnome city of Ak’Anon that lies southeast of the Faydark, on the continent of Faydwer.  Ak’Anon sprawls out under the Steamfont Mountains.

4002 AGNOSTIC<BR><BR>Agnostics will not commit to a belief in the existence or non-existence of any deity.
4003 BERTOXXULOUS - THE PLAGUEBRINGER<BR><BR>Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty.  The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost iridescent yellow/ green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things that his followers relish. It is not surprising that many of his followers pursue the dark art of necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in undeath, continue to rot and decay.  Do not take this to mean that his followers are suicidal or seek a quick death.  To the contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across all Norrath.
4004 BRISTLEBANE - KING OF THIEVES<BR><BR>Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun at the expense of nearly all else.  Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers, and gypsies are all typical followers.  They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty: traits all his followers should strive to possess. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged.  Practical jokes are performed as if they were the highest rituals.  Very few of his followers are outright wicked in their desires, but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are  about.  And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.
4005 CAZIC-THULE - THE FACELESS<BR><BR>Followers of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and believe that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath.  They strive to beat down and suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture, and living sacrifice are the tools of a Cazicite.  Many lizardman tribes are devout followers, but his number of humanoid patrons grows daily, a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a twisted nightmare of horror and pain.
4006 INNORUUK - THE PRINCE OF HATE<BR><BR>Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire dark elven race, who regard Him as their 'Father'.  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather 'THE' creative force in the universe.  Creativity is born of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain their ends.  It is only through the total disdain of one's enemies that one can gain true power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of his followers that if they were to hate strong enough, they could destroy all of Norrath.
4007 KARANA - THE RAINKEEPER<BR><BR>Followers of Karana believe in the absolute power of storms.  They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane.  The followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter from the elements to strangers.  Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle, traveling where the winds take them.  They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.
4008 EROLLISI MARR - THE QUEEN OF LOVE<BR><BR>Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love conquers all.  It should be pointed out that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi's worshippers are not pacifists.  They would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that world.  They have passionate loves of people, places, and ideals, and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things.  The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love.  Many paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow Erollisi Marr.
4009 MITHANIEL MARR - THE LIGHTBEARER<BR><BR>Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valor is what separates civilized beings from beasts.  His followers live by a strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity.  They are champions of the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this never ending quest.  They will not rest until the day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or mayhem.  Many paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
4010 RODCET NIFE - THE PRIME HEALER<BR><BR>Followers of Rodcet Nife take an oath to fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them.  They are very generous and humble, asking little more from their beneficiaries than that they pass on the kindness to others.  They are not content to deal with the effects of disease and death after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these evils. Healers and mystics are typical followers, but many noble rangers and paladins also have taken the Nife Oath.  They believe that through faith in the Prime Healer, the  wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended, and death's dark shadow will never be seen again.
4011 PREXUS - THE OCEANLORD<BR><BR>Followers of the Oceanlord believe true power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's oceans.  They believe that eons ago, life first formed in the murky depths and that one day, the oceans shall rise again to embrace the faithful and consume those who are unworthy.  The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water.  They seek to spread the word of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fisherman are followers of Prexus.
4012 QUELLIOUS - THE TRANQUIL<BR><BR>Followers of the Tranquil seek peace.  They are not strict pacifists, however, and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about.  The peace they seek is an inner one.  They wish to know all there is to know about themselves and the world around them.  They thirst for the knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment.  It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained.  If every creature  fully understood itself and its neighbors, there would be no need for conflict or war. Followers of Quellious typically follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly questing for knowledge and hoping to find themselves along the way.
4013 SOLUSEK RO - THE BURNING PRINCE<BR><BR>Followers of Solusek Ro believe in the raw and unbridled power of fire.  Fire birthed the world and in fire shall it be consumed. True aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is desired.  Power is gained by superior force.  Followers of Ro have little fear.  They are bold and brash and say what they mean and do what they say. Social graces are something they neither possess nor desire. They demand the respect of their peers and more often than not, earn it as well.  Those who seek true elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many wizards turn to his burning embrace.
4014 BRELL SERILIS - THE DUKE OF BELOW<BR><BR>Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste of space.  They find true happiness in the caves, caverns,  and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath.  But this is one of the few points that all the followers of Brell Serilis can agree upon.  There are many different factions who all worship Brell.  The Runny Eye goblin clan claims that He is their father, much to the disgust of the dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the dwarves are the true children of Serilis. The vicious gnolls of Paw disagree entirely, for was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis can be found, in one form or another, nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.
4015 THE TRIBUNAL - THE SIX HAMMERS<BR><BR>Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing above all else: justice.  While some claim to express this desire by pursuing careers as guards or magistrates, true believers in the Tribunal do not recognize the rights of any court on Norrath and enforce the Tribunal's sense of ultimate justice on the rest of the population.  Retribution, vengeance, and punishment are sacred duties. Followers of the Tribunal are methodical, patient and just.  They must be so, for it is their belief that if they punish an innocent, the Tribunal will pass judgment  against them, and doom them to an eternity of endless torment.
4016 TUNARE - THE MOTHER OF ALL<BR><BR>Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's children.  The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing being, to blossom and grow.  Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth.  Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land,  followers are paying homage and respect to the Mother of their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them.  Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all its forms.  Many druids, rangers, and a great many elves follow the ways of Tunare.
4017 VEESHAN - THE WURMQUEEN<BR><BR>Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that dragonkind is superior to all other forms of life.  They swear allegiance to the Mother of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or their loved ones to one of her children.  In return for this undying devotion, Veeshan is very protective and generous to her loyal followers.  Many humanoids have gained great riches and ancient knowledge through servitude to the wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they can take your messy life whenever it suits them.  To most followers of Veeshan, however, serving a deity is its own reward.
4018 RALLOS ZEK - THE WARLORD<BR><BR>Followers of Rallos Zek believe in the survival of the strong and extinction of the weak.  The heat of battle is the only place enlightenment can be gained.  The universe was formed by conflict and in conflict it will end.  The victors will feast upon the remains of the fallen.  No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were worthy, their hearts would still pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath.  Followers of Rallos Zek are almost exclusively warriors.

5778 Well met, soldier of Gukta. As a Warrior in the service of your god Mithaniel Marr, brawn and blood will be your greatest weapons, courage your lasting armor.  Know that those who follow Marr will look kindly on you and sometimes aid your efforts.  But beware.  The dark places of the world still hold many enemies.  Now go and find Dar Master Griblok.  He will begin you training in the way of the blade.
5779 Good tidings, wise one.  Though your god Mithaniel Marr now speaks clearly to other orders within Gukta, He whispered first through the spirits of the land.  As a Shaman, you listen still to His lasting words and to the other old voices.  The spirits will aid you when called, infusing allies with primal power while striking enemies with ancient wrath.  Use this power well, for the outcome of this age is far from certain.  Now go and find Yun Master Arglug.  There is much more you must learn.
5780 Peace to you, healer of Gukta.  As a Cleric, your life is forever dedicated to the service of your god Mithaniel Marr and his mortal aims.  Use your granted powers of healing and aid wisely.  Ease the suffering of the weak.  Tend the wounds of the strong.  For that is the secret of your power.  Now go, find Kor Master Gloorg so that you training can begin in earnest.  May Mithaniel guide your way.
5781 Welcome, wizard.  Your dedication to the knife's edge path of the arcane is no trivial choice.  You are the master of awesome and terrible energies, an arcane destroyer.   But do not forget the guidance of Mithaniel Marr.  He watches still.  Harness your purpose with the same dedication you tamed the wild energies of magic.  Now seek out Jin Master Sergug.  He will hone your skills.
5782 Our Lord's favor to you, sir knight.  You are the chosen of Mithaniel Marr, a Paladin, a blessed soldier in His eternal army.  You are a shining light in a world shrouded by evil.  Strike down all who would oppose your lord.  Smite any that seek to corrupt or defile His purpose.  Show only the mercy of your blade.  But first, find Shin Master Grubbus.  He will set you on the proper path.
5784 Only Frogloks may use this forge.

5797 You will become a strong fighter for the Berserkers of the Underfoot.  With Bristlebane as your god and inspiration, you will pursue mischief and the odd practical joke in your travels too.  As a stout and loyal dwarf, you will seek justice and fairness by the blade of your axe.  When there is a wrong, your might as a berserker will make it right.  In the great halls of Kaladim, you will learn much from your dwarven ancestors.  As a dwarf, you have a fondness for the barbarians, another strong and hardy race.  You will call many humans, gnomes, and halflings your friends.  However, when it comes to dark elves, trolls, ogres, iksar, and any evil race, it will make you burn with rage.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY

5799 In the cold and snowy Northlands, the formidable barbarian berserkers are charged with protecting their home city, Halas, and the surrounding lands of Everfrost.  As members of the Bloodrage Brawlers guild, young berserkers learn to master the rage that burns in their hearts and bodies and use it to overcome anyone who threatens them.  Barbarians feel superior to those with frail physiques, particularly Erudites and dark elves.  The Northmen are born with a hatred of ogres, trolls and other evil races.  However, barbarians feel a kinship with the dwarf race whom they view as their stout-hearted cousins. It is said that this fondness goes deeper than their mutual adoration of a good brew.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5800 Deep in the stone halls of the ogres' mountain home of Oggok, the Bonecutters guild raise and guide their young berserker members.  It is the duty of every ogre to learn to use their anger to charge their bodies and blades to defend their home and kin.  The Bonecutters see themselves as far more fierce and dangerous than the Craknek Warriors and Greenblood Knights.  They feel their gift with rage puts them above their brothers and sisters of the other guilds.  The Bonecutters berserkers feel they are the only ogres adequately equipped to protect and guard Oggok.  Walking the lands as an ogre can be treacherous, as most other races in Norrath will not welcome you.  For most ogres, this is acceptable as they have no great love for the good races.  Ogres also hate trolls and iksar, but will tolerate dark elves.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5801 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.  Be wary when traveling around Norrath as trolls are not loved by many races.  This dislike is returned by the trolls, too.  As you know, troll berserkers appear to hate everyone -- unless they are roasting on a spit or falling under a heavy axe. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5802 The proud and regal Vah Shir berserkers of the Ireheart Ragers guild welcome new members with open arms.  The Vah Shir spend many hours cultivating the talents of the berserker by helping them focus their inner rage to aid them in battle.  The Vah Shir berserkers are trained to have high endurance and their affinity for the spiritual world and nature allows them to quickly manage and focus their inner rage.  As a Vah Shir berserker, you will defend Shar Vahl and other Vah Shir with pride and determination.  When you are old and leave the moon, you will encounter many new and strange faces.  Most will welcome you.  Trolls, ogres, iksar, and dark elves will not. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5803 Nedaria's Landing
5804 There are some in Norrath that are born with an innate rage that, if controlled, can become a powerful weapon.  They are called berserkers.  The berserker is a master of the two-handed axe and of throwing weapons.  To keep their bodies light and swift, berserkers wear light chain armor.   <BR><BR>Berserkers are fearsome fighters that possess inordinate amounts of strength and bravery.  They lunge into battle swinging large two-handed axes or hurtling throwing weapons at their prey.  They carry huge axes because of the damage they deal and for the fear the weapons instill in the enemy.  As great as a berserker's skill with a two-handed axe is, his skill with throwing weapons cannot be overlooked.  As he becomes more powerful, he can infuse his rage into various thrown weapons, causing dire effects when they strike a foe. <BR><BR>With the mastery of his innate rage, the berserker also gains the ability to become "berserk" – a deadly state which causes a great amount of damage as a berserker's blade swings with frenzy.  As dangerous as berserkers are at these moments, they become more vulnerable to enemy attacks.    <BR><BR>Berserkers do not fear death and they value speed and agility over personal defense.  The berserker is at his best within a group of friends and adventurers that allow him to unleash his full anger on an enemy without interruption.  When standing within arm's reach of his enemy, the berserker is one of the masters of offense, crippling and maiming with impressive speed and skill.  And, in situations where an enemy must be fought at a distance, the berserker has the best throwing arm of any Norrathian.

5831 Deep in the stone halls of the ogres' mountain home of Oggok, the Bonecutters guild raise and guide their young berserker members.  As a follower of Cazic Thule, the ogre berserker lives in fear of the god of War and brings fright to others to appease the deity.  An ogre berserker with a mighty axe is fearsome indeed. It is the duty of every ogre to learn to use their anger to charge their bodies and blades to defend their home and kin.  The Bonecutters see themselves as far more fierce and dangerous than the Craknek Warriors and Greenblood Knights.  They feel their gift with rage puts them above their brothers and sisters of the other guilds.  The Bonecutters berserkers feel they are the only ogres adequately equipped to protect and guard Oggok.  Walking the lands as an ogre can be treacherous, as most other races in Norrath will not welcome you.  For most ogres, this is acceptable as they have no great love for the good races.  Ogres also hate trolls and iksar, but will tolerate dark elves.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5832 Deep in the stone halls of the ogres' mountain home of Oggok, the Bonecutters guild raise and guide their young berserker members.  With a strong belief in Rallos Zek, the ogre berserker fears nothing and focuses on great strength, victory, and power gained from battle. It is the duty of every ogre to learn to use their anger to charge their bodies and blades to defend their home and kin.  The Bonecutters see themselves as far more fierce and dangerous than the Craknek Warriors and Greenblood Knights.

5833 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  Those that worship Cazic Thule fear their god and avoid his wrath by instilling terror in others -- a task that is easy for a berserker with a mighty axe.  With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.  Be wary when traveling around Norrath as trolls are not loved by many races.  This dislike is returned by the trolls, too.  As you know, troll berserkers appear to hate everyone -- unless they are roasting on a spit or falling under a heavy axe. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5834 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  Choosing Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, as a deity is not a bad choice for a berserker as disdain can fuel the rage deep within. With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.

5835 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  With Rallos Zek, the Warlord, as a god and inspiration, the berserker believes that the strong rule the weak and that victory, courage, and brute strength are paramount to success in life. With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.
